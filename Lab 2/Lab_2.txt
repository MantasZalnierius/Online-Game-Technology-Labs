Lei the first for this lab were to download and install wireshark and to capture a packet using wireshark.
If you need screenshots for either let me know.

VERSION: This IP header field details a 4 bit version used for the packet i.e (IPV4).

HEADER LENGTH: This is a value that details the length of the IP header in 32 bit increments.

TOS(Type Of Service): This a 8 bit length binary number that details the QOS(Quality Of Service)
such as Precdence, Delay & reliability.

TOTAL LENGTH: This details the length of the IP packet which you get by (Header Length + Payload Length).
Max Size for a packet is (2^16 - 20) bytes.

IDENIFICATION: This is a unique 16 bit value for every datagram for a given source address.

FLAGS: is a 3 bit field that helps you control and identify fragments.

Bit 0 = reversed and set to 0.
Bit 1 = no fragment.
Bit 2 = more fragments.

FRAGMEN OFFSET: This is used to identify a sequence of fragments in the frame. 
It generally indicates number of data bytes preceding or ahead of the fragment. (2^16 - 20) bytes

TTL(Time To Live): Is a counter that is set and is decermented when a packet goes through a router.
This is needed as a packet can end up wandering aimlessly through the same routers.

PROTOCOL: This indicataes the protocol that will be used (i.e TCP/UDP)

HEADER CHECKSUM: This is a calculated 16 bit value of the content of the IP header to check if the header itself is not corrupt.

SOURCE IP: This is the source address the packet was send from.
DESTINATION IP: This the destination address that the packet is going to.

PADDING: Padding is used to make sure that the IP packet header has a length that is mutiple of 32 bits.

OPTIONS: these are options you can provide on a packet. One of these options is to record the route that the packet uses to get to it's destination.

Q5)
----------

The major difference between the packet you provided and the one I have captured and recorded in the IP header in Question 3 is,
that the protocol is different. The packet you provided uses ICMP whereas my packet uses TCP(6).
This is a big difference as protocols like TCP and UDP are for transfering application data.
While ICMP is a control protocol that transfers information about other protocols.
